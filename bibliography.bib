abstract = {The majority of pigmented skin lesions can be diagnosed correctly on the basis of clinical criteria; however, there remain a surprisingly high number of small pigmented lesions in which the distinction between melanocytic and non-melanocytic and benign and malignant lesions, and thus between melanoma and non-melanoma, is difficult or impossible to make with the naked eye. Epiluminescence microscopy is a non-invasive technique that, by use of oil immersion, makes sub-surface structures of skin accessible for in vivo microscopic examination and thus provides additional criteria for the diagnosis of pigmented lesions. The technique of epiluminescence microscopy is reviewed, and the significant improvement in the clinical diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions and, in particular, melanoma by this technique is documented.}

Malignant melanoma can masquerade clinically as benign lesions (false negatives), and benign pigmented lesions can clinically simulate malignant melanoma (false positives). Histologic examination of pigmented lesions is therefore important to ensure proper diagnosis and treatment. We review many of the published reports of benign lesions mimicking melanoma and melanoma masquerading as other entities as well as present additional cases of clinical misdiagnoses of melanoma.

The convolutional neural network (Microsoft ResNet-152 model; Microsoft Research Asia, Beijing, China) was fine-tuned with images from the training portion of the Asan dataset, MED-NODE dataset, and atlas site images (19,398 images in total). The trained model was validated with the testing portion of the Asan, Hallym and Edinburgh datasets. With the Asan dataset, the area under the curve for the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, intraepithelial carcinoma, and melanoma was 0.96 ± 0.01, 0.83 ± 0.01, 0.82 ± 0.02, and 0.96 ± 0.00, respectively. With the Edinburgh dataset, the area under the curve for the corresponding diseases was 0.90 ± 0.01, 0.91 ± 0.01, 0.83 ± 0.01, and 0.88 ± 0.01, respectively. With the Hallym dataset, the sensitivity for basal cell carcinoma diagnosis was 87.1\% ± 6.0\%. The tested algorithm performance with 480 Asan and Edinburgh images was comparable to that of 16 dermatologists. To improve the performance of convolutional neural network, additional images with a broader range of ages and ethnicities should be collected.}

decades, making its early diagnosis a continuing public health priority. The
ABCD (Asymmetry, Border irregularity, Color variegation, Diameter \\&gt;6 mm) acronym
for the appraisal of cutaneous pigmented lesions was devised in 1985 and has
been widely adopted but requires reexamination in light of recent data regarding
the existence of small-diameter (≤6 mm) melanomas.Evidence AcquisitionCochrane Library and PubMed searches for the period 1980-2004 were conducted
using search terms ABCD and melanoma and small-diameter melanoma. Bibliographies of retrieved articles were
also used to identify additional relevant information.Evidence SynthesisAvailable data do not support the utility of lowering the diameter criterion
of ABCD from the current greater than 6 mm guideline. However, the data support
expansion to ABCDE to emphasize the significance of evolving pigmented lesions
in the natural history of melanoma. Physicians and patients with nevi should
be attentive to changes (evolving) of size, shape, symptoms (itching, tenderness),
surface (especially bleeding), and shades of color.ConclusionsThe ABCD criteria for the gross inspection of pigmented skin lesions
and early diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma should be expanded to ABCDE (to
include “evolving”). No change to the existing diameter criterion
is required at this time.}",

abstract = {Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. Over the past few years, different approaches have been proposed to deal with automated skin cancer detection. Nonetheless, most of them are based only on dermoscopic images and do not take into account the patient clinical information, an important clue towards clinical diagnosis. In this work, we present an approach to fill this gap. First, we introduce a new dataset composed of clinical images, collected using smartphones, and clinical data related to the patient. Next, we propose a straightforward method that includes an aggregation mechanism in well-known deep learning models to combine features from images and clinical data. Last, we carry out experiments to compare the models’ performance with and without using this mechanism. The results present an improvement of approximately 7\% in balanced accuracy when the aggregation method is applied. Overall, the impact of clinical data on models’ performance is significant and shows the importance of including these features on automated skin cancer detection.}
